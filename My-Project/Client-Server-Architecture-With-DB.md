#               CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE WITH DATABASE


Client-Server Architecture with Database is a type of distributed computing architecture that consists of two or more computers connected to each other over a network. 
The computers are known as clients and servers. The client is the computer that requests services from the server, while the server is the computer that provides the services.

A database is a collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. 
It is used to store and retrieve data from the server.

The diagram below illustrates the client-server architecture with database.

In this architecture, the client computer sends a request to the server computer. 
The server computer then retrieves the requested data from the database and sends it back to the client computer. 
The client computer then processes the data and displays the results.

The client-server architecture with database is a popular architecture for distributed computing applications. 
It is used in many applications such as web applications, enterprise applications, and mobile applications. 
It is also used in many databases such as Oracle,
