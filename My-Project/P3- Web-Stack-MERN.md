## WHAT IS MERN STACK ?
MERN stack is a combination of technologies used to develop web applications. It stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. These technologies provide a great technical foundation for developers to build web applications with a highly secure front-end and robust back-end. MongoDB is a NoSQL database used for storing data, Express is a web application framework for Node.js, React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment used for executing JavaScript code on the server side.

# MERN STACK OVERVIEW.

MongoDB: MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for storing data in JSON-like documents. It is a cross-platform, open-source database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling.

Express: Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It is used for building web applications and APIs. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used for creating reusable UI components. It is used for developing single-page applications and mobile applications.

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment used for building server-side applications. It is used for developing fast and scalable network applications.

These four technologies are used together to create modern web applications. MongoDB is used for storing data, Express is used for building the backend, React is used for building the frontend, and Node.js is used for running the application.

## I will implement a solution base of MERN stack in AWS Cloud.
